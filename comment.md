1. The used IRI "JensDeSutter.github.io/#me" can be invalidated if my github username changes, making the IRI not 100% permanent. 
2. Using this method, a content-type cannot be requested. The type is fixed: "Content-Type: text/html". 
3. Cross Origin Resource Sharing is allowed, as seen in the option "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" 
4. HTTPS is used. 
5. This method uses caching, as can be seen by "X-Served-By: cache-ewr18131-EWR" "X-Cache: MISS" "X-Cache-Hits: 0". In this case a cache missed occurred. After retrieving the data again we get a cache hit: "X-Served-By: cache-ewr18131-EWR" "X-Cache: HIT" "X-Cache-Hits: 1".
6. Compression is also supported in this method: "Content-Encoding: gzip"
7. It is not possible to subscribe to the data, polling is necessary to keep the data up to date.
